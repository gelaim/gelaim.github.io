# Projects


## Thesis Crafter: Artificial Intelligence for document management

[website](https://www.thesiscrafter.com/)(portuguese only)

I'm co-founder and CEO.

We have some interesting findings using NLP in brazilian legal documents.
We can find the structure of legal documents, and evaluate missing information.
Developing internal tools using Python, pytorch, numpy, pandas, fastapi, git and docker

## Sigon Framework: research project

Sigon is a framework for the development of agents as multi-context systems. It is generic and extensible in the sense that it allows modeling agents according to existing architectures or to create new ones, as well as to extend an agent construction with additional features through other contexts and bridge rules.
The framework is developed using JAVA, ANTLR and Maven.

## HackerRank Solutions: programming project

This is a [new hobby](https://github.com/gelaim/HackerRank), and doesn't necessarily reflect my skills. Sometimes I just write the first solution with a reasonable time and space complexity. 
All my answers are developed using Python.

## Machine learning, AI and Pytorch

In this [project](https://github.com/gelaim/data_science), I'm trying to organize some of my knowledge about several fields of AI. I stared writing about statistics, but now I want to write also about ML and DS. I also have some work using [Pytorch](https://github.com/gelaim/pytorch-cookbook) about Pytorch and AI in general. 
For now, I want to have a well-organized set of information.


## Road awareness: research project

This is a study on aspects affecting situational awareness of smartphone users in the vicinity of urban traffic.
A virtual environment is developed to simulate the immersion in the urban environment, 
free of the inherent dangers of testing in real scenarios.
The virtual environment was developed using Unity and C#.
Statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-test and regression) were performed using Python.
